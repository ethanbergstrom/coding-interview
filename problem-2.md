## Problem 2:

You are tasked with modifying the script from the previous problem to handle updated requirements, while maintaining input passivity for the operator.

### Requirements:

1. All requirements from Problem 1 still hold true, **except** if `Microsoft Edge` is installed alongside `.NET Framework` and `Nuance Dragon Medical One`, `.NET Framework` must be upgraded to at least version `4.8.1`
    * As in the previous problem, system state for `Microsoft Edge` is speced in `edge.json`
